## Client

### Good to know:

### About
What if we want a simple way of connecting to Discord? The `client`-feature
allows us to create a Client-instance and this struct keeps our connection to
Discord.

A client empowers us to issue authenticated REST-requests but also manage
shards.\
Oh, and while we are talking about shards, shard-management is automatic by
default. Therefore, if your bot grows, Serenity will spin up more shards.
